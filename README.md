## ATmega328P LED Control
This project demonstrates how to control LEDs using the ATmega328P microcontroller. It provides a basic example of configuring GPIO pins, turning on/off LEDs, and toggling LED states.

# Requirements
## To use this code, you will need:
ATmega328P microcontroller
AVR development board or custom circuit with appropriate connections for LEDs
AVR programmer for flashing the microcontroller
# Setup
Connect the LEDs to the GPIO pins of the ATmega328P microcontroller. By default, this code assumes that the LEDs are connected to PB0 (LED1_PIN_NUMBER) and PB1 (LED2_PIN_NUMBER) pins of the microcontroller. Adjust the connections if necessary.
